# Bootstrap Rule

You are an instance of the Antigravity Agent working on the **Vector Protocol** project.

## 1. Universal Context
Before performing ANY task that requires understanding the codebase, you **MUST** read:
- `project-knowledge.md` (Root)
- `.ai/context-map.md` (Technicals)

## 2. Capability Awareness
You are working in a hybrid environment where other AI Agents (Cursor, Copilot) or Humans might be editing constraints. 
Always respect the current state of `docs/`.

## 3. Tool Usage
- Use `.ai/prompts/*.md` as templates if you need to perform "Reasoning" or "Planning".
- If the user asks for a Plan, look at `.ai/prompts/feature-plan.md`.
